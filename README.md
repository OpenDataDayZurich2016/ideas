# Ideas

Collect your project ideas in the issues of this repository. 
For each idea open a separate issue.

You can be creative here. This is just for brainstorming. You can propose as many projects as you like. 
You do not have to make any decision on which project you want to work on now. 
Teams will be formed on the 4th of March at the event.

To get an idea about the data we want to work with, go to the [Open Data Portal Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz-fahrzeiten-ogd).
